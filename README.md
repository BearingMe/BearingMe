# Greetings, thou art invited to my hideout 🔥

Welcome to my personal GitHub account, here I store all my creative genius 💡. 

Every project I like, being big or small, old or new, may be showcased here. So, don't be surprised if you come across a classic "hello world" written in some ancient legacy boilerplate language like Java, it is all part of the journey 🚀.

### Who am I?
- 👋 A.k.a Smith
- 💬 He/Him, It/Its or Honey
- 🎓 Student of ~Civil~ Computer Engineering
- 🐍 Python lover, 🦀 Rust fanatic & 🐧 Linux nut
- 🇯🇵 Fan of Japanese culture & 🇮🇹 Italian music
- 🤪 Speaking English like a boss... sorta

### Where is my code?

I leave my code scattered across the GitHub universe. Depending on the vibes, you'll find it in one of these three places:

- 🌍 [Main Projects (BearingMe)](https://github.com/BearingMe?tab=repositories) — general-purpose stuff, experiments, fun times
- 🧰 [Boilerplates (BearboxProject)](https://github.com/orgs/BearboxProject/repositories) — templates and structured starting points
- ⚗️ [Hype Zone (ChemicalElements)](https://github.com/orgs/ChemicalElements/repositories) — for when inspiration hits and naming conventions disappear

---

I hope you enjoy browsing through my work and feel free to reach out if any questions.

Passa una bella giornata, bye! 🌈
