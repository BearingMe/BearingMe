# Greetings, thou art invited to my hideout 🔥

Welcome to my personal GitHub account, here I store all my creative genius 💡.   

Every project I like, being big or small, old or new, may be showcased here. So, don't be surprised if you come across a classic "hello world" written in some ancient legacy boilerplate language like Java, it is all part of the journey 🚀.   

### Who am I?
- 👋 A.k.a Smith
- 💬 He/Him, They/Their, It/Its or Honey
- 🎓 Student of Civil Eng
- 🐍 Python lover, 🦀 Rust fanatic & 🐧 Linux nut
- 🇯🇵 Fan of Japanese culture & 🇮🇹 Italian music
- 🤪 Speaking English like a boss...sorta

### Where is my code?
I created some organizations to keep things clean. You can start with those:
- [Cli Projects][0]: cause GUI is for mortals
- [Web Scrapping][1]: for when I want to waste more hours building a program than it would take to copy and paste the whole site 
- [Backend Development][2]: you know, databases are fun
- [Frontend Development][3]: the glamour of coding, who wouldn't love it?
- [DevOps][4]: because infrastructure is just a chore
- [Miscellaneous][5]: where I go crazy

I hope you enjoy browsing through my work and feel free to reach out if any questions. ~Also, don't click on those buttons below, they are not working.~  
Passa una bella giornata, bye!
