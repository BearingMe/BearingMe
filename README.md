# Greetings, thou art invited to my hacker hideout 🔥🎉

Welcome to my personal GitHub account! Here I store all my creative genius 💡.   
Every project I like, being big or small, old or new, may be showcased here. So, don't be surprised if you come across a classic "hello world" written in some ancient legacy boilerplate language like Java, it is all part of the journey 🚀.   

### Here is a little about me:
- 👋 People call me Smith;

- 🎓 Studying Civil Eng;
- 🐍 Python lover, 🦀 Rust fanatic & 🐧 Linux nut
- 🇯🇵 Fan of Japanese culture & 🇮🇹 Italian food;

Well, that's all folks. I hope you enjoy browsing through my work, feel free to reach out with any questions!
